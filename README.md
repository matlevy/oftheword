# oftheword

A curious project studying the linguistics of the Biblical: and further text; beginning with the King James Bible, and with further aim to the Latin Vulgate, and Hebrew Torah; examining the connectivity of cognates within the structuring of words, and phrases, in order to establish a potential source of a phenomenam of a pattern of design within the English, and other Languages;

Founded on an understanding of Proto-Indo-European Linguistic Theory, and further scientific truths of lunguistics, a peculiar phenomenom of connectivity of wording, within the design, and capability of abstraction of the latin alphabet can be observed.

The following image shows a peculiar phenomenom of mapping the first instance of a given letter within such writing, and a divisability of the alphabet by vowels, to create a map of letter and cognates:

The following image then demonstrates, usitilising the above map: when spelled, using these simple understandings of first occurance of letter, regognisable cognates appear in abstract relation to the given word;

This tool is designed to asssist with developing an understanding of such phenomenom. Opening with a question of whether further linguistical expertise was invested in the design of the language of such books, and to try to assertain the details of such phenomenom.
