    <div><h3>Genesis 1:1-2 The Opening & Root Map</h3></div>
    <div class="notes">
      <p>
        Through observation it was noted that the opening two verses of Genesis,
        within the King James Bible, of which is the focus of this phenomenam,
        contain an hundred and fifty six letters: seven by twentytwo; reflective
        of seven forms of conciouss understanding of oneself, and existence;
      </p>
      <p>
        Each grid has also been designed to show seven vertical forms, and, for
        the purposes of interest, index values of letter positioning within the
        Latin Alphabet have been attributed with tallies of count for each form;
      </p>
      <p>
        Within these opening letters, twenty of the twentysix letters can be
        mapped using a simple system of observising the first occurance of a
        given letter, and noting the previous two letters as [A], and [B]: and
        [C] being the first occurance of a given letter;
      </p>
      <p>
        Below each line are the letters of the alphabet, restarting at where the
        scripture cuts with a grammatical symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disscussions within this writing are omly of note of observations of
        design, based on connectivity of cognate letters, and phenomenom
        observable;
      </p>
      <p>
        Of first observation is: by dividing this text, as one continious
        stream, into columns of twentytwo, only vowels appear in the first
        position of each row: maintaining the idea of vowels realating to the
        root divisions of the alphabet; and this same phenomenam can be observed
        with starting, end ending letters of scriptures;

          Of the first form, observing the combinations of these ideas, as a
          tool to create a map of thought, when taken only in written form,
          [GOD] is positioned vertically over [Q]: of the cognate [QUE]; to
          represent an idea of a point where all questions, and answers within
          oneself is placed;
        </p>
        <p>
          [IN] is over [AB], and [T] over [C]: and when noticing each letter as
          an abstract, and how each maps with abstract divisions of the
          alphabet, we begin to see a phenomenam of representations of letters
          used within English words, to map cognate thought, and self awareness;
        </p>
        <p>
          [INT] is a common congate used with the word "internal": and removing
          [N] one can see [IT]: the primary cognate to focus upon within life,
          representative of ones eye of truth;
        </p>
        <p>
          Crossreferencing the above table: words, can be used to describe five
          steps of thought, each a mapped aspect of ones conciouss awareness:
          [IN] to [THE] to [BEGINNING] to [GOD] ([GO], and [DO], in reverse) to
          [CREATE] <i>thought</i>: with each section of such mapped to a
          sequence of letters, the alphabet, to describe oneself, and
          crossreferenced, by letter, to explain the element of oneself involved
          in this process
        </p>
        <p>
          Of particular note, as phenomenam, and not to be interpreted as
          encoded instruction, are numerical values of tallies corresponding to
          the divisions of the Alphabet: of particular, 144 corresponding to
          [O], discussed further in writting, and values of Theta, or the Golden
          Ratio; and sequences of digits corresponding to the division of seven
          under twenty two, to the start of the sequence, consistently
          reflective within many faiths, and a consistent theme within later
          texts: and key verses within scripture;

          Noticing the first form can be used to represent that at the root of
          thought, we can also see only the vowels [IEO] are used, and the
          second form utilising only [AE]: the second form representing
          placement;
        </p>
        <p>
          [THEEARTH] mirrors in design [THE], combining a reversal of [R], in
          [REA], from [CREATE]: and when duplicated, we see [EAR], [HEART]
          within [EARTHEARTH], connected to other words by [TH];
        </p>
        <p>
          Within [DA], of [AND], is [THEE], to understand later usage of such
          word: given [DA] is a reversal of [AD], and considering our root means
          of attaching chain of thought (A, B, C), this maps [D] to [A] in such
          steps, before [A], to express by design unfamiliarity associated with
          the word [THEE];
        </p>
        <p>
          [ED], of which used within English writing as to form past tense, is
          placed above [WX], and letters [THOG] of [THOUGHT] positioned above:
          expressing the notion of past tense being an observation of a truth,
          occured, and collected within mind;
        </p>
        <p>
          [HEAVEN] is placed within, and above [B], and [G], within the Alphabet
          sections; and [EAV] above, connective to [E]; the cognate [AVE],
          within [EN] of [HEAVEN]; and the reversal of [TER], of [WATER], above
          [HEAVEN];
        </p>
        <p>
          [AND], by design, and placement, expresses a connection of thought
          process; placing [AN] within [ND], of [AND], connected [HEAVEN], and
          [THE], outwardly by [ET]; and, by the center point of such, connects
          to [I] within the Alphabet divisions, and by letter usage of [GINI] to
          [BEGINNING], but also placing [IN], within [GI];
        </p>
        <p>
          Of note is the application of the word [SATAN]: noting letters of such
          connect within points of [AND], [HEAVEN], and [THE]: implying, by
          design, as to be seen of the placement of [S], within the third form,
          to be a representative of an element inner self, adjoined between such
          points, and connected to [THEEARTH] of consious understanding; an
          element within one where thoughts pass through, before placement;
        </p>
        <p>
          As one progresses through the vertical cross-reference of the forms,
          one can see, although scrambled in appearence, cognates representative
          in relation to the theme of placement; and reflective of later
          verbage;

          Within row [F], representative of form, over [ABCDEFGH], letters
          constructing [GARDEN], implicit of placement of such concept as a

        <p>
          Within row [G], representtive of a notion of gathering, over the

          Of the third form is the connection [W]: placed within [H], and [A]:
          placing [AS] within [W]; and [THOU] within [IT]; and [HOU] within
          [TT]; [WAS] is paired with [H], using the cognate [TW];
        </p>
        <p>
          Noting the vertical forms, [WAS] is placed within [REA], and [THW]:
          implicit that such cognate positioning implies that of [WAS] is within
          a pairing of such to be known [TW], surrounding ones collections
          within existence [H], and that read [REA], but also connected to all
          truth collected [O];

        <p>
          [RT] is within [AH], connecting [WAS], and [SAW] to [THEEARTH]: and

          [WITH];
        </p>

          The letter design of the third form provides a picture of the root of
          where decision, and thought is connected, and formed: [WITHOUT]
          expresses the concept of outward form, because when providing a
